# SOLID Design Principles

## SRP

### Single Responsibility Principle

- separation of concerns
    - different types/packages handling different, independent tasks/problems
- A type should only have one reason to change

## OCP

### Open-Closed Principle

- Types should be open for extensions but closed for modifications

## Liskov

### Liskov Substitution Principle

- You should be able to substitute an embedding type in place of its embedded part

## ISP

### Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface
- Split into separate interface

## DIP

### Dependency Injection Principle

- High-Level modules should not depend upon low-level modules
- use abstractions
